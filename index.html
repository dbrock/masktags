      <h1>Masktags and Multilingual Tweeting</h1>
  
      <p class="preamble">If you speak more than one language and use
        Twitter internationally, you might have run into some problems.
        Most importantly, <strong>how do you tweet in a language that
        only some of your followers understand</strong>, without
        annoying everybody else? <span style="font-size: 70%; padding-left: 1em">(See below for <a href="#tldr">the
            short version</a>.)</span></p>
  
      <p>There are two common solutions to this.  The simplest one is to
        keep mixing tweets in different languages until everybody who is
        too annoyed by the gibberish stops following you.  Problem
        solved:</p>
  
      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="solution-1.png" width="536" height="412"
             alt="Example illustrating the first solution."/>
      </div>
  
      <p>A more sophisticated solution is to create a separate Twitter
        account for each language that you want to tweet in:</p>
  
      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="solution-2.png" width="534" height="127"
             alt="Example illustrating the second solution."/>
      </div>
  
      <p>I’ve tried this,</p>
  
      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="solution-2-alt.png" width="538" height="145"
             alt="Another example illustrating the second solution."/>
      </div>
  
      <p>and while it solves the original problem, you get a whole
        sample pack of new problems in return.  Which may be fine,
        depending on how you use Twitter, and how comfortable you are
        with Twitter-induced multiple personality disorder.  For me, it
        was too awkward.  And besides, I can only make four more
        psychologist appointments and then my insurance company needs to
        approve any additional ones.</p>
  
      <p>Since neither solution has worked well for me, I’ve simply kept
        my public tweets strictly in English:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Whenever I’ve linked to Swedish content, I’ve made it very
            clear by sticking “[Swedish]” after the link.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Whenever I’ve retweeted something in Swedish, I’ve first
            translated it into English and then used a “TRT” prefix, for
            “translated retweet”.  (I still find this useful, by the
            way.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Most importantly, whenever I’ve thought of something myself
            to say in Swedish, I’ve either found a way to express it in
            English or else just shut up:</p>
          <div class="screenshot">
            <img src="solution-3.png" width="535" height="57"
                 alt="Example of me not having anything to say."/>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Until now.</p>
  
      <h2>The solution</h2>
  
      <p>Fast forward about a year, and I’m in Brighton (lovely place,
         by the way) making breakfast smalltalk with an old lady whose
         demented tendencies kind of remind me of Twitter-induced
         multiple personality disorder.</p>
  
      <p>That’s when I suddenly realize how to solve the multilingual
         tweeting problem without losing half of my followers, without
         contacting my insurance company, and without lobbying for the
         addition of any new language features to Twitter itself.</p>
  
      <p>The idea is simple and almost too good to be true.  I call it
        “masktags”.  It’s similar to hashtags, only it doesn’t involve a
        hash, and it masks stuff.</p>
  
      <p>To understand it, you have to remember how @-replies work in
        Twitter.  If you’re following me, and I send an @-reply to
        someone, it shows up in your timeline, <em>but only if you’re
        following that other person as well</em>.</p>
  
      <p>That’s the key: This filtering — or <em>masking</em> — aspect
        of @-replies.</p>
  
      <p>So what about it?  Well, I’ve set up an account
        called <a href="http://twitter.com/inswe">@inswe</a>, which I
        recommend everybody who speaks Swedish to follow.  It doesn’t
        matter whether or not you intend to use this directly: Someone
        who you follow may use it, and then you’ll miss their tweets
        unless you follow @inswe.</p>
  
      <p>That point deserves to be made again: <strong>If you speak
        Swedish, then you should
        follow <a href="http://twitter.com/inswe">@inswe</a>, or you
        will miss stuff if and when someone you follow starts using the
        “@inswe” masktag.</strong>  Note that the @inswe account itself
        will not send out any tweets.  It is simply an empty and unused
        dummy account.</p>
  
      <p>Once a sizable portion of your Swedish followers are
        following @inswe, you’re all set.  Tweeting in Swedish without
        annoying people is as simple as starting your tweet with the
        “@inswe” masktag:</p>
  
      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="final-solution.png"/>
      </div>
  
      <p>It doesn’t get much simpler than this — even in theory!</p>

      <p>I’ve just started
        a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>
        masktag as
        well: <a href="http://twitter.com/injbo">@injbo</a>.  If you
        have this problem but you’re neither a Swede nor a Lojbanist,
        go ahead and start a masktag for your own language.</p>
  
      <p>Now we just have to come up with masktags for all the other
        annoying things people talk about on Twitter.  Like sports.  Or
        American politics.</p>

        <h2 id="tldr">The short version (for Swedes)</h2>
    
        <p>If you understand Swedish and use Twitter, you should start
          following the so-called Swedish masktag,
          <a href="http://twitter.com/inswe">@inswe</a>:</p>
    
        <div class="screenshot">
          <a href="http://twitter.com/inswe"><img src="how-to-follow-inswe.png"/></a>
        </div>
        
        <p>Now, if you usually tweet in English but want to say
          something in Swedish without being annoying, you can do
          that.  First, you should warn people in advance, either by
          referring them to this page or by tweeting something like
          this:</p>
    
        <div class="screenshot os-x">
          <img src="how-to-explain.png" alt="Image of an unsent tweet
               with the text “I’m going to start tweeting in Swedish,
               but you won’t see those tweets unless you follow
               @inswe. Please do that if you understand Swedish.”"/>
    
        <p>Then, simply start any Swedish tweets with “@inswe”:</p>
    
        <div class="screenshot os-x">
          <img src="how-to-tweet-in-swedish.png" alt="Image of an
               unsent tweet with the text “@inswe Käkar ärtsoppa med
               pannkakor och hjortrongrädde. #win”"/>
        </div>

        <p>Only people who follow both you and @inswe will see that.</p>
