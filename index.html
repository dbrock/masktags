    <h1>Masktags and Multilingual Tweeting</h1>
    
    <p>If you speak more than one language and use Twitter
      internationally, you may have run into some problems.  Most
      importantly, how do you tweet in a language that some of your
      followers understand (Swedish, in my case — or even Lojban),
      without annoying everybody else?</p>

    <p>(See bottom for <a href="#tldr">TLDR</a>.)</p>

    <p>There are two common solutions to this.  The simplest one is to
      keep mixing tweets in different languages until everybody who’s
      annoyed by the gibberish stops following you.  Problem
      solved.</p>

    <p>The other solution is to create a separate Twitter account for
      each language that you want to tweet in.  I’ve tried this, and
      while it solves the original problem, you get a whole sample
      pack of new problems in return.  Which may be fine, depending on
      how you use Twitter, and how comfortable you are with
      Twitter-induced multiple personality disorder.  For me, this was
      too awkward.  Besides, I can only make four more psychologist
      appointments and then my insurance company needs to approve any
      additional ones.</p>

    <p>Fast forward about a year, and I’m having breakfast in Brighton
      while talking to an old lady who for all I know may have
      non-Twitter-induced multiple personality disorder.  Definitely
      dementia, anyway.  Anyway, out of the blue, I suddenly realize
      how to solve the multilingual tweeting problem --- without
      losing half of your followers, without contacting your insurance
      company, and without any modifications to Twitter itself.</p>

    <p>The idea is simple.  I call it “masktags”.  It’s similar to
      hashtags, only it doesn’t involve a hash, and it masks
      stuff.</p>

    <p>To understand it, though, you have to remember how @-replies
      work in Twitter: if you’re following me, and I send an @-reply
      to someone, it only shows up in your timeline if *you’re*
      following the *other* person *as well*.  That’s the key.</p>

    <p>Now, I’ve set up an account called @inswedish, which I
      recommend everybody who speaks Swedish to follow.  It doesn’t
      matter whether or not you intend to use it directly: Someone who
      you follow may use it, and then you’ll miss their tweets unless
      you follow @inswedish.</p>

    <p>(That point deserves to be made again: If you speak Swedish,
      then you should follow @inswedish, or you will miss stuff if and
      when someone you follow starts using the “@inswedish” masktag.
      Note that the @inswedish account itself will not send out any
      tweets.  It is simply an empty and unused dummy account.)</p>

    <p>Finally, tweeting in Swedish without annoying your non-Swedish
      followers is as simple as starting your tweet with “@inswedish”.</p>

    <p>It can’t get much simpler than that, even in theory.</p>

    <p>Now we just have to come up with masktags for all the other
      annoying things people talk about on Twitter.  Like sports.  Or
      politics.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Still TLDR?  See even farther down for an illustrative comic
      (with pictures!).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you understand Swedish and use Twitter, start following
        <a href="http://twitter.com/inswedish">@inswedish</a>.</li>
    
      <li>If you usually tweet in English but want to say something in
        Swedish without annoying your non-Swedish followers, start
        your tweet with “@inswedish”.  (When doing this for the first
        time, it’s probably a good idea to let people know in advance
        so that anyone who understands Swedish can start following
        @inswedish if they don’t already.)</li>
    </ul>
